  <h1>Privacy Policy for Math Addict</h1>
  <p>
    Math Addict does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data. 
    As the owner of this extension, I do not have access to any information about users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only piece of data tracked is the in-game balance, which allows players to 
    continue their progress between sessions. This data is stored locally on the 
    user’s device using Chrome’s local storage APIs. It is never transmitted to me 
    or to any external servers.
  </p>
